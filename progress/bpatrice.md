=Weekly Progress=
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Week 1** - Worked on everything in main until we start to modularize our code. I Added a doublylinkedlist that holds nodes which hold objects. I made a bunch of helper functions for the linked list, nodes, and objects. I created functions to detect when an enemy exceeds bounds so we can deallocate the memory. I created a function that takes two objects and checks if they collide. In the collision function I added padding so the collision detection is less sensitive.

**Week 2** Still working in the main.c file for now. I reworked linked list functions so you can now append and insert anywhere in the list rather than just at the beginning and end.
