=Weekly Progress=

SEPTEMBER 1, 2025

Communicated with the class and the professor about my concerns regarding my limited experience with programming and github repositories. Successfully obtained assistance with connecting my raspberry pi to the data-fall2025
github repository. Made progress in learning and adapting my previous experience with programming in Python to C/C++. I remain actively engaged with the class when time permits. Also reminded myself that everyone has to start
somewhere to manage internal distress. Next goal is to create a singly-linked list in C and implement it with the class project.

SEPTEMBER 5, 2025

Struggled mightily with getting vircon32 installed on my pi. Through
conference with the professor and my classmates, I scrapped the preinstalled
32-bit pi build and restarted with a 64-bit build. Next plans are to begin
tinkering with the software if I can finally get it installed.
