**week 3** : 
Currently trying to fit things together into main. I have done some small changes to linked list, adding proper removal functions and checking edge cases. I also have made an effort to expand general functionality with the `object` struct, like a generic draw function. And I reintroduced a laser type to handel all of the projectiles. My next goal is to integrate weapons with players and lasers with weapons.
