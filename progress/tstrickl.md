=Weekly Progress=
Week 1: as a preamble to this week I helped to create a sort of foundation such as the gamemanager, object struct, player struct, vector functions, weapon, etc. After which I started focusing on creating a prototype music loop, creating a background sprite, then a debugger (which is buggy at the moment), and finally I have been working on a doubly linked list implementation, which has two seperate structs: doubly node and doubly linked list. The doubly node file is responsible for functions that link nodes together, while the doubly linked list file is supposed to keep track of the head and tail, and remove stuff and change those fields dynamically. Now for the player struct, I imbeded the type object as one of its fields, so that it can be downcasted and upcasted, as to simulated that fact that player IS an object as it derives from object. Anytime you do    
Object* = (Object*)player;, it will work, aswell as the reverse as long as you are careful and make sure you are making the right check precautions: Player* = (Player*)Object;
