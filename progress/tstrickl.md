=Weekly Progress=
**Week 1**: as a preamble to this week I helped to create a sort of foundation such as the gamemanager, object struct, player struct, vector functions, weapon, etc. After which I started focusing on creating a prototype music loop, creating a background sprite, then a debugger (which is buggy at the moment), and finally I have been working on a doubly linked list implementation, which has two seperate structs: doubly node and doubly linked list. The doubly node file is responsible for functions that link nodes together, while the doubly linked list file is supposed to keep track of the head and tail, and remove stuff and change those fields dynamically. Now for the player struct, I imbeded the type object as one of its fields, so that it can be downcasted and upcasted, as to simulated that fact that player IS an object as it derives from object. Anytime you do    
Object* = (Object*)player;, it will work, aswell as the reverse as long as you are careful and make sure you are making the right check precautions: Player* = (Player*)Object; I also think i have just finished the doubly linked list implementation within the main branch, as i have multiple instances of player in a list, and i am loopin throught the list to update them all, though there might be some bugs that need fixing.

**Week 2**: I have been working on a debugger for both the linked list and object in general. the general object debugger is functions, where it reads the passed in object data and prints it to the screen as it changes every frame. The data that is printed groups all of the fields into seperate categories: position, dir, and misc. Next i was finalizing the implementation of a debugger for the lined list. What it does it is creates lines that follow the path of each next node and previous node. the line being drawn from one object to another (represented by periods) is the forward direction in the list, while the commas represent the backwards direction in the list. In order to make this possible, i had to use some principles from geometry and triganometry. First of all, i get the position of the two objects in the linked list on the screen, and calculate the distance between the two. This distance in and of itself is the hypotenuse of the triangle that is made between the object's positions. each period, or comma, to be drawn on the hypotenuse line between the two points form tiny triangles, within the bigger triangle. This is why i can use cos and pythagorean theorem to figure out the position of these points because this triangle is put within the bigger triangle, which makes a simular triangle through the theorem of ANGLE-ANGLE-SIDE. this theorem mean that the smaller triangle and bigger triangle share the same triganometric ratios.
